		<section>
			We can link to a file in the same directory as this HTML file like this:
			
			<a href="same-directory.html" title="same dir link">Linking the file in the same directory</a>

			<!--The way we create links is by specifying an 'a' element which is also known as an 'anchor tag' with a "href" and "href stands for Hypertext Reference"-->

			<!--The value of "href" can either be a realtive or an absolute URL -->

			<a href="same-directory.html" title="same dir link">
				<div> DIV Linking to a file in the same directory</div>
			</a>

			<!--The title attribute is used by the screen readers that help the visually impaired people get through the web page -->
		</section>

		<!--Since we are providing no directory information the browser will assume that the same-directory is a file that lives in the same directory as internal-links. -->
